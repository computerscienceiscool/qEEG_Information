This is a working document.  
Please let me know if there are some reqources that are especially helpful in learning to read qEEGs, specifically from the perspective of a data analyst.

** What is QEEG Brain Map(Dr. Roseann Capanna-Hodge ): **
QEEG or Quantitative electroencephalography is an important diagnostic tool that will help you better understand exactly what is going on with your child.

QEEG brain mapping greatly helps in identifying brain wave patterns and shows you everything thatâ€™s wrong with your brain. In relation to mental health, brain mapping detects neuropsychiatric disorders, dementia, brain injuries, mental health disorders, and more.

The changes in a childâ€™s mood, behavior, and personality may be explained by the assessment from the QEEG brain mapping. Hence, itâ€™s best to have knowledge about this diagnostic tool that will guide us in helping our children have a good mental health condition and ensuring that their brain functioning is better.

Why is it important to collect data from the brain?

In our brain behavior reset program, we have QEEG and brain check. These are simply ways to collect data from the brain. So we donâ€™t just guess about mental health.

The standard of mental health care is to get more information about your brain wave activity and brain function. So you go in the room, you tell your symptoms, and nobody's really checking. They just make you fill out a detailed questionnaire. And what these methods do is allow us to collect data from the brain.

Why is that important? We know about the many functions of the brain and that it has certain areas that do specific functions. An acute electroencephalogram (EEG) is deemed to be magical because it shows us exactly what regions are overstimulated, what areas are overworking and what areas are under-stimulated.

**Dr Joel Lubar: QEEG brain mapping:**
interview recorded in 2019 with Dr. Joel Lubar, a pioneer in EEG Neurofeedback and QEEG Brain Mapping research.

Dr. Lubar was responsible for developing the use of EEG Biofeedback (Neurofeedback) as a treatment modality for children, adolescents, and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, starting with his controlled studies in the mid-1970's. This application of Neurofeedback is now becoming widespread in clinics and schools throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel, Europe and Mexico. Currently, more than 1500 health care organizations are using the EEG biofeedback protocols that Dr. Lubar has developed.

**The Human Condition: QEEG and Loretta **
Brain waves can be measured with a quantitative electroencephalograph that delivers no radiation or electricity into the patient. Color pictures of brain regions, frequencies and power output are produced and compared to normal levels. The reliability is high, and the brain is just waiting to tell us what it needs. Technology has brought new depths and layers of data for our use.
